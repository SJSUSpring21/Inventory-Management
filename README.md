# Inventory-Management

**#IDEA1 - Approved**

**Introduction:**
Inventory and Machinery management tracking application for recording, tracking resources and assigning responsibilities.

**Abstract:**
Many construction sites in India use paper-based forms to record each transaction like inward and outward requests to the inventory. If the companies start digitalizing the records, the data will be very helpful to access future projects that they plan to take up and also it is very important to keep track of each single resource/machine in big construction projects.

**Approach:** 
We will build a dashboard which records every single transaction and also able to link each transaction to the person who is responsible to it. The Dashboard will be maintained by the admin where he can add resources, people and record each outward/inward request.

**Persona:**
This will be helpful to all the construction companies who are facing difficulties in tracking their resources and optimizing the costs involved in it.
